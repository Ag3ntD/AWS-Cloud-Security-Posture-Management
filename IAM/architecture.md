## Architecture
Event-driven IAM monitoring system. When IAM configuration changes occur (CreateUser, AttachUserPolicy, CreateRole, AttachRolePolicy, PutUserPolicy, CreateAccessKey, UpdateAssumeRolePolicy), EventBridge captures these events via CloudTrail logs and triggers a Lambda function. Lambda validates IAM entities by querying the IAM API to check for risky configurations (overly permissive policies with wildcards, admin access, cross-account trust relationships, missing MFA, inactive credentials), stores findings in DynamoDB with state tracking (ACTIVE/RESOLVED), and sends SQS alerts only on state transitions (NEW_FINDING, REOPENED_FINDING, RESOLVED_FINDING).

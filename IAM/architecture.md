## Architecture
Event-driven IAM privilege escalation monitoring system. When IAM policy changes occur (AttachUserPolicy, PutUserPolicy, CreateUser, DetachUserPolicy, DeleteUserPolicy), EventBridge captures these events via CloudTrail logs and triggers a Lambda function. Lambda evaluates IAM users by querying the IAM API to analyze both attached and inline policies, identifying users with iam:PassRole permissions combined with execution service permissions (lambda:CreateFunction, ec2:RunInstances, ecs:RunTask, cloudformation:CreateStack), which enables privilege escalation through role assumption, stores findings in DynamoDB with state tracking (ACTIVE/RESOLVED), and sends SQS alerts only on state transitions (NEW_FINDING, REOPENED_FINDING, RESOLVED_FINDING).

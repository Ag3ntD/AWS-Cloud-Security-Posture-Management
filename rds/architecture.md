## Architecture
Event-driven RDS monitoring system. When RDS configuration changes occur (CreateDBSnapshot, ModifyDBSnapshotAttribute, DeleteDBSnapshot), EventBridge captures these events via CloudTrail logs and triggers a Lambda function. Lambda validates RDS resources by querying the RDS API to check for risky configurations (publicly accessible databases, unencrypted storage or connections, public snapshots, overly permissive security groups, missing deletion protection, disabled automatic backups, missing IAM authentication), stores findings in DynamoDB with state tracking (ACTIVE/RESOLVED), and sends SQS alerts only on state transitions (NEW_FINDING, REOPENED_FINDING, RESOLVED_FINDING).

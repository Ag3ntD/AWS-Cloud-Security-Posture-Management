## Architecture
Event-driven RDS monitoring system. When RDS configuration changes occur (CreateDBSnapshot, ModifyDBSnapshotAttribute, DeleteDBSnapshot), EventBridge captures these events via CloudTrail logs and triggers a Lambda function. Lambda validates snapshot permissions by querying the RDS API to check if the "restore" attribute is set to "all" (publicly accessible snapshots), stores findings in DynamoDB with state tracking (ACTIVE/RESOLVED), and sends SQS alerts only on state transitions (NEW_FINDING, REOPENED_FINDING, RESOLVED_FINDING).

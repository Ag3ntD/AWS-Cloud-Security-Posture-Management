## Architecture
Event-driven EC2 security group monitoring system. When security group ingress changes occur (AuthorizeSecurityGroupIngress, RevokeSecurityGroupIngress, CreateSecurityGroup, ModifySecurityGroupRules), EventBridge captures these events via CloudTrail logs and triggers a Lambda function. Lambda validates security group ingress rules by querying the EC2 API to check for public CIDR blocks (0.0.0.0/0 or ::/0), categorizes findings by severity based on exposed ports (CRITICAL for all ports, HIGH for SSH/RDP/database ports, MEDIUM for HTTP/HTTPS, LOW for others), stores findings in DynamoDB with state tracking (ACTIVE/RESOLVED), and sends SQS alerts only on state transitions (NEW_FINDING, REOPENED_FINDING, RESOLVED_FINDING).

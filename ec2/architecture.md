## Architecture
Event-driven EC2 monitoring system. When EC2 configuration changes occur (RunInstances, AuthorizeSecurityGroupIngress, AuthorizeSecurityGroupEgress, CreateSecurityGroup, ModifyInstanceAttribute, ModifySecurityGroupRules, AssociateIamInstanceProfile), EventBridge captures these events via CloudTrail logs and triggers a Lambda function. Lambda validates EC2 resources by querying the EC2 API to check for risky configurations (overly permissive security groups with 0.0.0.0/0 access on high-risk ports, public instances without proper controls, missing IMDSv2 enforcement, unencrypted EBS volumes, instances without IAM roles), stores findings in DynamoDB with state tracking (ACTIVE/RESOLVED), and sends SQS alerts only on state transitions (NEW_FINDING, REOPENED_FINDING, RESOLVED_FINDING).
